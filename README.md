# tomenet-graphic-tiles
Graphical tiles for [TomeNET](tomenet.eu)

# Usage
Currently can be used only on experimental [TomeNET graphics branch](https://github.com/jezek/tomenet/tree/use_graphics).
Copy the content of this repository's lib directory, to your installed, graphics supporting, TomeNET lib directory and modify your TomeNET config file to use graphical tiles ([howto](https://github.com/jezek/tomenet/commit/3ff3548b845ac0bcbbe03a67bd12d941af069865)).

# What's done?
Just most of the 9x15 floor tiles.

See animated screenshot using graphics, together with [Tagar's tileset - 1 bit graphical font](https://tomenet.eu/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1149).
